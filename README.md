main_script is script created to search the logs, this script will be read the configuration file that is in the config/project_uno.cfg.

Configuration in main_script itself only input which folder do you plan to put. I created it for person who maintain application in many servers.

I created the summary first, for the details in project_uno.cfg will be update. Please enjoy it, btw i just lear python just last 30 days so please discuss to me if you have another trick to simpliest the script.

Thank you.
